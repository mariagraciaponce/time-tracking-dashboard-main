## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

JavaScript is kind of a nightmare, I think I understand it and suddenly I need to specify something further or nothing works. I hope that with each challenge it gets a little bit easier. 
But I'm really proud of the HTML and CSS, I feel that it's clean and really understandable

### Continued development

100% I need to continue learning about JS, I honestly don't think that a know anything at this point, and surely it will get more complicated.
